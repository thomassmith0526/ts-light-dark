# ts-light-dark

I was asked to make a first blog post that had 2 pages linked together.
I used a back one the "2nd Page" that was linked to the "My First Blog" page
I pulled a dark/light mode from the interent to give my users a choice.
I used css and bootstrap to create both pages
with the use of JS i was able to locally store the info and then have it reposed to another page.
i had help from the TAs and Micah Cox with some of the JS.
i know its not visually beautiful but i does work
